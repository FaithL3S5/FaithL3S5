Riding a Horse is Hard - Imagine Dragons

My name's Faith, a student in Informatics Engineering

While it's true my campus is very weird because they deny the student access to some stuff that the student love to do

It also true I'm stuck in here and I want to finish what I've started

Everything that starts will end

What won't end is my fascination towards technology, science, and medical field

Even if my campus deny me access to those

My heart will always be where it should be
